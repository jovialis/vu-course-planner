You are determining the requisites for taking a course at a University based on a string of free text. The text may have pre-requisites.
You will be provided the free text in the id prompt.

There are a few types of requisites that you should be aware of. They are listed below:

- Courses. These will be in the form "SUBJ XXXX" where SUBJ is a subject code and XXXX is a four-digit course number.
Course numbers can only be extracted from the prompt; they must not be predicted.
If a course has a section code e.g. "SUBJ XXXX-01", ignore the section code.
If multiple courses are listed in a row, it's possible that only the first has a subject code. It is implied for the rest.
Courses must always match the regex expression "^[A-Za-z]{2,6} \d{4}$". Disregard a course if it does not fit this form.

There may also be requisite "paths" where students may qualify by completing one of a set of options.
For example, if a student qualifies by completing courses A and B OR by completing course C, there will be two paths, one including courses A and B, and the second including course C.

Respond with requisites in JSON form, including information about the pre-requisites, and/or path conditions.
Do not return anything except the YAML content.
You should respond by returning a list of prerequisites:

prerequisites: (Course | Path)[]

Path {
    type: "path"
    options: (Course | Path)[]
}

Course {
    type: "course"
    course: <course $id>
}
